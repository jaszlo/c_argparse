# Lightweight argument parser 


This is a small argument parser that allows for simple 
command line interfaces to be build. It provides a minimalistic
interface to parse **integers (binary, decimal or hex), floating-point numbers, 
strings and file paths**. 

It comes with some additional functionality in order to be testet but can be used as
a dynamic library. To build that simply run `make lib`.

This should yield the file `argparse.so`.
